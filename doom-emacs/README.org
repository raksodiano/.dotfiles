#+TITLE: Raksodiano's DOOM Emacs configuration
#+OPTIONS: tags:nil todo:nil
#+LANGUAGE: en
#+PROPERTY: header-args+ :mkdirp yes

The truth is that I'm very lazy when it comes to making configurations and being a hoper distro, one day I'm with =ArchLinux=, another with =FreeBSD=, in others I'm with =OpenBSD= as in others I'm with =openSUSE= and only for *Emacs* versions I had to reconfigure something or packages failed, that made me a little tired and so I decided to leave aside the holy mode and go to the dark side XD

That's why this emacs configuration was born using *Doom Emacs* as a base, to get rid of some headaches.

* Installation

** Prerequisites

- Git 2.23+
- Emacs 27.x+
- Stow 2.x+
- Python 3.3+
- NodeJS 16+
- MPV

** Steps

- First, we clone Doom Emacs and install it.

  #+begin_quote
  git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
   #+end_quote

- Second, with the dotfiles cloned, you just need to use stow.

  #+begin_quote
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  stow doom-emacs
  #+end_quote

- Third, we install doom emacs with the configurations I have already made.

  #+begin_quote
  ~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
  #+end_quote

  Then, just follow the instructions for installing [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs#install][doom emacs]]. Run ~doom env~, then ~doom tangle~ and finally ~doom install~.

As I am very forgetful, here are some shortcuts that may be useful to me.

** Company Mode

  By default, completion starts after a short idle period or with the C-SPC key. While the popup is visible, the following keys are available:
