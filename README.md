### Dotfiles manager ###

I'm using [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) a free, lightweight
dotfiles manager written in Perl to manages my dotfiles.

What's make differentiates it from other dotfiles managers is that it does
not require various Python, Ruby or Perl dependencies like most dotfiles
manager.

With that, it is easy to share files among multiple users or computers with a
few command lines.
