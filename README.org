* Dotfiles Manager

I'm using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/][GNU Stow]] a free, lightweight
dotfiles manager written in Perl to manage my dotfiles.

What differentiates it from other dotfiles managers is that it does
not require various Python, Ruby, or Perl dependencies like most dotfiles
managers.

With that, it is easy to share files among multiple users or computers with a
few command lines.

* List of configurations:

- htop ➔ interactive process viewer
- emacs ➔ Extensible, powerful, editor
- zsh ➔ Customizable shell
- fish ➔ User-friendly, modern shell

* Getting Started

No matter what your Linux distribution, `stow` can easily be installed according
to your package manager:

**Arch Linux**
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo pacman -S stow
  #+END_SRC

**OpenSUSE**
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo zypper in stow
  #+END_SRC

**Fedora**
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo dnf install stow
  #+END_SRC

**Debian**
  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sudo apt-get install stow
  #+END_SRC

Once the installation is complete, make a clone of the repository:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  git clone https://github.com/raksodiano/.dotfiles.git
  #+END_SRC

You can now install any configurations you wish to copy using GNU Stow:

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # Make sure you are in the right directory
  cd .dotfiles

  # Example to install the htop config
  stow htop

  # Uninstall the htop config
  stow -D htop
  #+END_SRC
